# Get started with jenkins

## steps

1. Launch an ec2 instance(ubuntu or amazon linux preferred)
2. connect to the instance 


## install jenkins on aws ec2

- step 1
```
sudo apt update

```
- step 2

```
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jre

```

- step 3

```
java -version

```
The output would look something like this 

```
openjdk version "11.0.12" 2021-07-20 OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.12+7-post-Debian-2) OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 11.0.12+7-post-Debian-2, mixed mode, sharing)

```

- step 4

```
curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io.key | sudo tee \   /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null 



echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \   https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian binary/ | sudo tee \   /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null

```

- step 5

```
sudo apt-get update 

sudo apt-get install jenkins

```

- step 6

```
sudo systemctl enable jenkins
sudo systemctl start jenkins
sudo systemctl status jenkins

```

Enable port 8080 on security group to run jenkins on port 8080.

3. Login to jenkins

```
sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword

```
- The above command will return a string {dhfdhfdkodhdghodgh} paste it into the jenkins administration password.

- Install suggested plugins

- login into jenkins

### Now inside jenkins

1. Create new item

2. Give a name to the project

3. Choose freestyle pipeline

4. Select github project and enter the url

5. Add credentials (we will create ssh keys for connecting)

### inside ec2 write 

```
ssh-keygen

```
6.It will generate public and private key pair(just keep pressing enter)

7.cd .ssh

8. You will find two keys id_rsa and id_rsa.pub

9. id_rsa is private key while id_rsa.pub is public key

```
 cat id_rsa.pub
 
```

10. Copy the hash and open github

### Inside github

1. Open settings

2. go to ssh and gpg keys

3. New ssh key

4. Give it a title

5. Inside the key input paste the hashstring.

6. Add ssh key

7. Open Jenkins and click on credentials.

8. Select ssh username and private key in kind.

9. for username select ubuntu.

10. for private key copy the id_rsa hashstring and paste into the input provided.

11. Id can be anything.

12. for branch select /master

13. click on save.

14. CongoðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰Your github and jenkins is integrated.

15. Go to the project and click on build now.

16. Go to your ec2 instance and move the file

```
cd /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/node-to-do
```

17. You will see all your files and folder from the github has been added to the jenkins.

18. Install all the dependencies needed to run the app like Nodejs,Flask or whatever specified in the project.

19. Install **Docker** on the instance.

```
sudo apt-get install docker.io

```

20. Go to Jenkins and click on configure app
21. click on build steps and select shell
22. write all the steps performed.

```
docker build . -t node-todo
docker run -d --name TODO_APP -p 8000:8000 node-todo

```
23. click on save
24. Click on build now
25. give permission to the ec2

```
sudo usermod -aG docker jenkins
systemctl restart jenkins
```
26. Restart jenkins
27. Click on build now

# Now we will be working with webhooks

__ We will make a CI/CD  pipeline that whenever user pushes the code on github it will trigger the build __ 

1. Go to manage jenkins
2. Install plugins
